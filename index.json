We used these tiny visual actions to investigate how intention modulates sensorimotor awareness by directly comparing intended, unintended, and spontaneous microsaccades. In addition, we dissociated the effects of action intention and the actions' visual consequences on awareness. In 80\\% of all trials, we presented a stimulus at high temporal frequency rendering it invisible during stable fixation. Critically, the stimulus became visible when a microsaccade in the same direction caused it to slow down on the retina (generated microsaccade condition; 40\\% of trials) or when the microsaccades' visual consequence was replayed (replayed microsaccade condition; 40\\% of trials). Participants reported whether they perceived the stimulus (visual sensitivity), whether they believed they had made a microsaccade (microsaccade sensitivity), and their level of confidence that their eye movement behavior was linked to their perception (causality assignment). Visual sensitivity was high for both, generated and replayed microsaccades and comparable for intended, unintended, and spontaneous eye movements. Microsaccade sensitivity, however, was low for spontaneous microsaccades, but heightened for both intended and unintended eye movements, showing that the intention to saccade or fixate enhances awareness of otherwise undetected eye movements. Visual consequences failed to aid eye movement awareness, and confidence ratings revealed a poor understanding of a causal relationship between eye movement and sensory consequence. These findings highlight the functional relevance of intention in sensorimotor awareness at the smallest scale of visual actions.","tags":null,"title":"Sensorimotor awareness requires intention: Evidence from minuscule eye movements","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am so incredibly happy that this preprint on sensorimotor awareness with Jan Klanke as first author is available on biorxiv.

What part of the physical world can be sensed is limited by biophysical constraints of sensory systems, but might be further constrained by the kinematic bounds of the motor actions that acquire sensory information. We tested this fundamental idea for humans’ fastest and most frequent behavior—saccadic eye movements—which entails retinal motion that commonly escapes visual awareness. We discover that the visibility of a high-speed stimulus, presented during fixation, is predicted by the lawful sensorimotor contingencies that saccades routinely impose on the retina, reflecting even distinctive variability between observers’ movements.

After prolonged exposure to causal launch events (the adaptor) defined by a particular set of features (i.e., a particular motion direction, motion speed, or feature conjunction), observers were less likely to see causal interactions in subsequent ambiguous test events. We assessed whether this negative aftereffect transfers to test events with a new set of feature values that were not presented during adaptation. Processing in specialized (as opposed to generalized) visual routines predicts that the transfer of adaptation depends on the feature-similarity of the adaptor and the test event. We show that negative aftereffects do not transfer to unadapted launch directions. Crucially, adaptation was contingent on the causal impression in launches as demonstrated by a lack of adaptation in non-causal control events. In contrast, adaptation to launches with a particular motion speed transferred also to a different speed. Moreover, adaptation based on feature conjunctions (color and launch direction) revealed that launch direction trumps the feature identity of the object for causal perception; the adaptation transferred across colors if the test event had the same motion direction as the adaptor. In summary, visual adaptation allowed us to carve out a visual feature space underlying the perception of causality and revealed specialized visual routines that are tuned to a launch’s motion direction.","tags":null,"title":"Visual routines for detecting causal interactions are tuned to motion direction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We have a website.

Memory can guide our actions, but actions also impact what we remember. Even during memory maintenance, actions such as saccadic eye movements select content in visual working memory, resulting in better memory at locations that are congruent with the action goal as compared to incongruent locations. Here, we further substantiate the claim that saccadic eye movements are fundamentally linked to visual working memory by analyzing a large data set (\u003e 100k trials) of nine experiments (eight of them previously published). Using Bayesian hierarchical models, we demonstrate robust saccadic selection across the full range of probed saccade directions, manifesting as better memory performance at the saccade goal irrespective of its location in the visual field. By inspecting individual differences in saccadic selection, we show that saccadic selection was highly prevalent in the population. Moreover, both saccade metrics and visual working memory performance varied considerably across the visual field. Crucially, however, both idiosyncratic and systematic visual field anisotropies were not correlated between visual working memory and the oculomotor system, suggesting that they resulted from different sources (e.g., rely on separate spatial maps). In stark contrast, trial-by-trial variations in saccade metrics were strongly associated with memory performance. At any given location, shorter saccade latencies and more accurate saccades were associated with better memory performance, undergirding a robust link between action selection and visual memory.","tags":null,"title":"Saccadic selection in visual working memory is robust across the visual field and linked to saccade metrics: Evidence from nine experiments and more than 100,000 trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is the playground to test local changes.\nAnd implement different settings.\n","date":1700438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700438400,"objectID":"585b8144115c5f114269f912f3443988","permalink":"https://mindinaction.github.io/extra/","publishdate":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/extra/","section":"","summary":"This is the playground to test local changes.\n","tags":null,"title":"Playground","type":"page"},{"authors":["Klotzsche","Gaebler","Villringer","Sommer","Nikulin","Ohl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688256000,"objectID":"771741aaf7f3ade7e813fd00134e18a5","permalink":"https://mindinaction.github.io/publication/klotzsche.psychophys.2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klotzsche.psychophys.2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Virtual reality (VR) offers a powerful tool for investigating cognitive processes, as it allows researchers to gauge behaviors and mental states in complex, yet highly controlled, scenarios. The use of VR head-mounted displays in combination with physiological measures such as EEG presents new challenges and raises the question whether established findings also generalize to a VR setup. Here, we used a VR headset to assess the spatial constraints underlying two well-established EEG correlates of visual short-term memory:the amplitude of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the lateralization of induced alpha power during memory retention. We tested observers' visual memory in a change detection task with bilateral stimulus arrays of either two or four items while varying the horizontal eccentricity of the memory arrays (4, 9, or 14 degrees of visual angle). The CDA amplitude differed between high and low memory load at the two smaller eccentricities, but not at the largest eccentricity. Neither memory load nor eccentricity significantly influenced the observed alpha lateralization. We further fitted time-resolved spatial filters to decode memory load from the event-related potential as well as from its time-frequency decomposition. Classification performance during the retention interval was above-chance level for both approaches and did not vary significantly across eccentricities. We conclude that commercial VR hardware can be utilized to study the CDA and lateralized alpha power, and we provide caveats for future studies targeting these EEG markers of visual memory in a VR setup.","tags":null,"title":"Visual short-term memory-related EEG components in a virtual reality setup","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://mindinaction.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://mindinaction.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://mindinaction.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Rolfs","Ohl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"55c582d77ef8655b30f7bf67b85ecbb0","permalink":"https://mindinaction.github.io/publication/rolfs.bbs.2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rolfs.bbs.2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In active agents, sensory and motor processes form an inevitable bond.

In particular, benefits for congruent over incongruent items were largely constant across set sizes ranging from two to eight items (Experiment 1), showing that saccadic selection imposes priorities on vstm irrespective of memory load and is effective even when only few representations need to be maintained. Moreover, a decrement in performance for incongruent items occurred reliably, whether the congruent location contained a task-relevant item or an irrelevant noise patch (Experiment 2). Finally, saccadic selection was immune to a strong manipulation of the observer's attentional priorities (Experiment 3). Given the prevalence of saccades in natural vision, our results demonstrate a fundamental and ecologically relevant selection mechanism for vstm. Saccades systematically eliminate information seen at non-target locations, while information at the saccade target remains available to recall.

An intrasaccadic step—following a sinusoidal variation as a function of the trial number (with 3 different frequencies tested in separate blocks)—consistently displaced the target along its vector. The oculomotor system responded to the resulting feedback error by modifying saccade amplitudes in a periodic fashion with similar frequency of variation but lagging the disturbance by a few tens of trials. This periodic response was superimposed on a drift toward stronger hypometria with similar asymptotes and decay rates across stimulus conditions. The magnitude of the periodic response decreased with increasing frequency and was smaller and more delayed for Global than Two-way adaptation. These results suggest that—in addition to the well-characterized return-to-baseline response observed in protocols using constant visual feedback—the oculomotor system attempts to minimize the feedback error by integrating its variation across trials. This process resembles a convolution with an internal response function, whose structure would be determined by coefficients of the learning model.
